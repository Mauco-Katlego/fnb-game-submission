========================================
Mancala Game - Console Application
========================================

This is a console-based implementation of the Mancala game in Java. The game is designed to be played by two players, where each player tries to capture as many stones as possible.

## Rules of the Game

Mancala is a two-player game. The objective is to capture as many stones as possible from your opponent's side into your Mancala pit.


### Game Rules

1. At the beginning of your turn, select a small pit from your side (row) with stones in it.
2. Pick up all the stones from the selected pit.
3. Distribute the stones one by one in a counter-clockwise direction, placing one stone in each pit, including your Mancala pit but excluding your opponent's Mancala pit.
4. If the last stone you drop lands in your Mancala pit, you get an additional turn.
5. If the last stone you drop lands in an empty small pit on your side, and your opponent has stones in the opposite pit, you capture all the stones in your pit and the opposite pit and place them in your Mancala pit.
6. The game continues until all small pits on one player's side are empty.
7. The player with the most stones in their Mancala pit at the end wins the game.
